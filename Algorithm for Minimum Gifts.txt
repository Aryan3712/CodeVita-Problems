				>>>Minimum Gifts<<<
				Solved By: Aryan Walia
A Company has decided to give some gifts to all of its employees. 
For that, company has given some rank to each employee. 
Based on that rank, company has made certain rules to distribute the gifts.
The rules for distributing the gifts are:
Each employee must receive at least one gift.
Employees having higher ranking get a greater number of gifts than their neighbours.

What is the minimum number of gifts required by company?
Constraints
1 < T < 10
1 < N < 100000
1 < Rank < 10^9
Input
First line contains integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case:
First line contains integer N, denoting the number of employees.
Second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the rank of each employee.
Output
For each test case print the number of minimum gifts required on new line.
Example 1
Input
2
5
1 2 1 5 2
2
1 2
Output
7
3
Explanation
For testcase 1, adhering to rules mentioned above,
Employee # 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts
Employee # 3 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 4 whose rank is 5 gets two gifts
Employee # 5 whose rank is 2 gets one gift
Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7
Similarly, for testcase 2, adhering to rules mentioned above,
Employee # 1 whose rank is 1 gets one gift
Employee # 2 whose rank is 2 gets two gifts
Therefore, total gifts required is 1 + 2 = 3

>>Algorithm

Step 1: Input the number of testcases
Step 2: for every testcase, input the number of employees N and then input an array of 	their ranks
Step 3: initialize a counter and assign it the value of num of employees(since an 	employee gets atleast one gift)
Step 4: Iterate through the array to check 
	if index is less than index+1, if true then increment the counter by 1
Step 5: return or print the counter
